# Networking in C

<div style="font-family:'Courier new'">
This is just a small repo to keep track of my learning progress in C networking and sockets. I mostly got inspired in my class at UCSC (CSE130) since one of our assignments is making an http server in pure C. Feel free to use my notes or code for your own references or learning material
